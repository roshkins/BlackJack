# Welcome to my Blackjack game!
I'm excited that someone is playing my game! This game was coded in two days by none other than me, Rashi King Abramson.

Help is provided in the status bar at the bottom of the screen. Just compile and run or go to the bin directory and download the executable.

Have fun!
